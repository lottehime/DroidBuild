Android Emulator Build Env & Build Script
for PS Vita & ARM WebKit POC Approximation 
-------
Modification of env setup script by TEAM RADIUM (https://github.com/TeamRadium)
Originally designed for setting up Android emulators for PS Vita WebKit POC work.

Setup your machine or VM with Ubuntu 12.04 first.

Run the script to setup and build a default image (4.0.1).
Use
```
    --auto    
```
to run the script in a mostly automated fashion.


If you wish to change the make parallelism, or to change the target Android version you wish to build then head to the commented section in the bottom end of the script.
Target versions can be found here: https://source.android.com/source/build-numbers.html

This hasn't been used in a while, so there may be broken parts. Don't say I didn't warn you! :D
